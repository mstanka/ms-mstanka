I completed my first front-end challenge!! I’m excited about it because I found it a fun project. I was completely absorbed in it for several days, and what’s important, I learned a lot of new things.

The challenge was offered by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and the task was to build a landing page based on the design for desktop and mobile. On the platform, they provided you also with a starter code and a style guide. There is no time limit for you, so you can start whenever you want. Just download it and go ahead.

I decided on [Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100). The decision was easy because I didn’t notice that there were more possibilities to chose from, and this one was for beginners. So I went straight into it.

I downloaded the starter code and read through the instructions for coding. After that I continued with the instructions on how to use GitHub and how to create a repository there. At that time I wasn’t familiar with GitHub.

I created [my repository](https://github.com/mstanka/huddle-landing-page) and wrote my code from scratch using HTML and CSS. For layout, I decided on Flexbox and I have to admit that nested Flexbox was a challenge to me.

With nested Flexbox, I had to think out and correctly apply styles for containers and items. Suddenly an item became a new container and styles for the container should be used on the item. I draw schemas and watched the Wes Bos tutorial [What the Flexbox](https://flexbox.io/) to understand what should apply where.

I had to figure out more issues, e.g. how to use vector image and how to style it. Because of the footer, I needed to change the colored logo to the white logo to use it on the black background. And the button calling for action was also a good one…

Finally, it was a short code, but I rewrote it several times. I’m not still completely satisfied with some parts, however, I decided to move on and deployed my solution on [GitHub Pages](https://mstanka.github.io/huddle-landing-page/) and call it finished.
