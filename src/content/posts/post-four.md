I listened to the podcast [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/04/30/jamstack-content-management-with-scott-gallant-jordan-patterson-and-nolan-phillips/), where I heard about TinaCMS.

In the past, I used WordPress for building my websites. WordPress is the most widely used Content Management System (CMS) written in PHP.

However, as the future trend of web developement seems to go towards JAMstack, I was interested in learning what TinaCMS is.

JAM stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup.

*It's a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and better developer experience.*

Tina is open-source site editing toolkit for React-based sites like Gatsby & Next.js. Using it you can manage content on your site directly, not on another platform. You can open the sidebar, edit your site and watch the content updating in real-time.

I was curious so I used a [starter template](ttps://github.com/tinacms/tina-starter-grande) to explore more.

The starter offers following features

- Fully integrated with TinaCMS for easy editing
- Blocks based page & form builder
- Styled Components
- Code syntax hightlighting
- Light/Dark mode

You can check my [live project demo](https://ms-gatsby-tinacms.vercel.app/) or [code](https://github.com/mstanka/ms-gatsby-tinacms).

I liked the experience. The site quickly loaded pages and the editing feature on the sidebar is pretty straightforward.
