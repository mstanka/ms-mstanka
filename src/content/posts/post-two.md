For my second challenge withÂ [Frontend Mentor](https://beta.frontendmentor.io/), I decided to build a page calledÂ [Base Apparel coming soon](https://beta.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0). At my first quick look, it seemed to be easy.

However, I found out soon that there are a lot of small details, which needed to be solved with CSS. And besides it, there was an email input for which I needed to write an email validation using JS. I had no idea how to do it.

Recently, I started to studyÂ [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)Â and I intended to use it at my first opportunity. And the opportunity came just now.

*So for this challenge, my main targets were to use Sass and learn how to implement email validation.*

For installation of Sass, I usedÂ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)Â and npm (Node Package Manager) on the command line. I followed the instructions on how to create package.json and set up my environment for using Sass. I started writing my code and was a little bit confused that my final main.css file is in a different folder than my working main.scss file. It didnâ€™t seem to be practical for me.

In the meantime, I watched youtube videos with some coding tips, and I came across the fact that an extension in VS Code Editor exists calledÂ [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass). I installed it and set up my repo again from the beginning. I realized that itâ€™s a better option than my first attempt using Node.js.

When I was writing my page with Sass, I implemented only variables and nesting. I didnâ€™t use mixins, partials or any other features. I will keep this in mind to practice it next time.

My second target was to figure out how the email validation works using JS and it was a tricky one as I have very little experience with JS. After a lot of googling and searching for the solution that will match my needs, I wrote something which partly works, however not 100%. When the input is empty it also submits the form and itâ€™s not correct. Iâ€™m not satisfied with it and no one could be.

Finally, when writing this article I found a free course on Udacity which may help me with it. Itâ€™s calledÂ [JavaScript and the DOM.](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-and-the-dom--ud117)Â I plan to watch the course and revise my JS code after that.

So, for now, I would callÂ [my second Frontend Mentor challenge](https://github.com/mstanka/base-apparel)Â incompletely completed and waiting for an improvement ðŸ™‚
