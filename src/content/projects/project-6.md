Frontend Mentor is a platform offering challenges to built solutions, and after that, get them commented on by the community.

Jobs listing with filtering is one of my solutions for Frontend Mentor. 

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size 
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page 
- Filter job listings based on the categories
