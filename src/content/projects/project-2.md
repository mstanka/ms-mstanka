Captured is a project for Chingu Voyage 19 called Photography Studio landing page. The design of the pages is inspired by a template layout and adjusted to my purposes.

It is a responsive static page, mobile-first, with a multipage layout. It is built using HTML & CSS/Sass, BEM with Grid & Flexbox. For the contact form, I used Javascript validation.
