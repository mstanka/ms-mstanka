This project is a travel website about the French island RÃ©union created as a final project for Czechitas Digital Academy.
Data are collected based on our own experiences and information obtained from locals. The traveler can find a photo gallery, trip ideas, and general tips for living on the island. Trips can be searched on an interactive map or filtered by difficulty and type, or sorted by distance from the traveler's current location.
