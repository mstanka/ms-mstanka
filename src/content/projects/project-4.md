Movie DB is a project built following a tutorial on Udemy by Thomas Weibenfalk. It uses Create-React-App and fetches data from The Movie DB API.

I extended the tutorial to display data also for each actor on a separate page.

What I've learned in this tutorial

- Use Create-React-App
- React Fundamentals
- State, Props and the flow between components
- Create and use React Components with Hooks and classes
- Styled Components
- fetch data from an external API
- Use localStorage and sessionStorage to keep state
