Frontend Mentor is a platform offering challenges to built solutions, and after that, get them commented on by the community.

Dine Restaurant is one of my solutions for Frontend Mentor. It is a responsive static page, mobile-first, built using HTML & CSS/Sass with BEM methodology. For layout, I used Grid & Flexbox, and I tried to match the provided  Scatch/Figma design as much as possible. For the reservation booking, I used a contact form with Javascript validation.
