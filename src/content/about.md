I build modern responsive websites using [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) approach. After several websites built on Wordpress, I found excitement in using HTML/CSS and Javascript's libraries and frameworks. I learn about programming in general, about UI/UX design, cloud technologies, and other interesting topics.
